# hello-world
My first repository
My name is Humaira Zafar and live in Chicago, IL. I am new at coding and learning it with the hope that one day I will be good at it. I do find coding fascinating and exciting. I need to commit myself to work on it for atleast 2 hours each day. 
I am very excited to start learning web development and create new projects.
